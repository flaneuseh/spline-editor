# Svelte Spline Editor

A simple Svelte project for creating animation splines. View the [demo](https://github.com/flaneuseh/spline-editor/blob/main/demo.mov)!

Before you start, `npm` must be installed.

To run the spline editor, run the commands `npm install`; `npm run build`; `npm run start` in the terminal. Then
the app should open at `http://localhost:5000` (or another port if 5000 is
unavailable).

Click anywhere in the graph to add a point; the radial buttons indicate the
spline curves available. Points may be moved by clicking and dragging, and you
can view the coordinates of a point by hovering over it.
